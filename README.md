[![build](https://github.com/paolofulgoni/geodist/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/paolofulgoni/geodist/actions/workflows/build.yml?query=branch%3Amain)

This REST API provides a single endpoints to get the geographical distance between two points:

```
POST /distance HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "pointA": {
    "latitude": 53.297975,
    "longitude": -6.372663
  },
  "pointB": {
    "latitude": 41.385101,
    "longitude": -81.440440
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "distance": 5536.338682266685,
  "unit": "km"
}
```

## ðŸŽ  Run

You can easily run the service from your computer, but you'll have to compile it first. Therefore, you need to:

* Install the [.NET 7 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/7.0)
* Clone the repository locally

Then use the dotnet CLI to run the service. Make sure you're on the root folder of the project, then type:

```shell
dotnet run --project ./Geodist
```

This will use the `Development` Hosting environment, therefore you can open a browser to http://localhost:5072/swagger and have fun with the Swagger UI.

Press `CTRL+C` when you're done.

## ðŸ”§ Build and test

Make sure [.NET 7 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/7.0) is installed on your dev environment. Then just open the project with your IDE of choice.

If you want to build the project using the .NET CLI, run the following command from the project's root folder:

```shell
dotnet build
```

The project contains some unit and integration tests. You can run them with the following command:

```shell
dotnet test
```
